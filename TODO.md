- send_mail
    - suppport multiple "To"s on send_email
    - support CC and BCC on send_email
    - Evaluate sending attachments on send_email
- Implement retry logic and backoff
- Authentication
- Check errors overall - if they are correctly logged and handled/returned in the right places
- Add logic to retry failed job
- check redis docs on operations used and document stuff like ZREM nonexisting members are ignored and operation doesn't fail
- check /TODOs
- Check database connections configurations on each application (api, worker, ...)
- Create doc explaining how to setup local database
- check context timeouts used in database calls. is it reasonable? how it affects eventual timeouts that come from above context?
- Consider returning a tx in some database methods to rollback in case of errors down the line. Like updating a job on the database and then
removing from redis queueu that fails.
- handle case where creating a job on db succeeds but enqueue on redis fails
- add doc to code: interfaces, types, var, methos, etc. check how it's done in the standar library (what goes on interface and what goes on impl)
