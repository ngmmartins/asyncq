- JOBS
    - endpoint to allow editing a job that was not yet runned (but maybe not allow edit runAt? because it's already enqued with that score)
    - add job database indexs
    - endpoint to manually retry a job (if failed)
    - handle case where creating a job on db succeeds but enqueue on redis fails
    - recurring jobs
- TECH DEBT
    - Check errors overall - if they are correctly logged and handled/returned in the right places
    - check redis docs on operations used and document stuff like ZREM nonexisting members are ignored and operation doesn't fail
    - Consider returning a tx in some database methods to rollback in case of errors down the line. Like updating a job on the database and then removing from redis queueu that fails.
- OPTIMIZATIONS
    - Check database connections configurations on each application (api, worker, ...)
    - check context timeouts used in database calls. is it reasonable? how it affects eventual timeouts that come from above context?
- DOCS
    - Create doc explaining how to setup local database
    - add doc to code: packages, interfaces, types, var, methos, etc. check how it's done in the standar library (what goes on interface and what goes on impl)
- MONITORING
    - metrics, monitoring
        - n jobs by status
        - avg time to run, failures, retries
- AUTHENTICATION
    - implement GET /v1/api-keys excluding hash and plaintext. 
    - implement DELETE /v1/api-keys/:id	to delete/revoke a key
    - implement PATCH /v1/api-keys/:id	to update name or something else?? check if makes sense
    - consider having a backgroud goroutine to clean expired tokens
- check /TODOs
